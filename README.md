This is Capstone Project Assignment

Description

My Backroom Capstone Project commences with the innovative creation of 3D character designs that are fundamentally simple yet highly engaging, infused with a unique and eerie aesthetic that captivates. This game is meticulously designed to provide a bright, colorful, yet subtly creepy environment in which players can freely explore using an intuitive and comprehensive control system. This includes sophisticated inputs for basic movements such as walking and turning. The characters are deliberately designed to perform simple, iconic actions like walking and waving hands, with these animations running seamlessly and smoothly within the powerful animation cycles of Godot, ensuring a fluid gameplay experience.
The game is richly populated with a diverse array of monsters, including spiders, beasts, and killers, each bringing vitality and a unique flair through their distinct and repetitive behaviors. There are a total of six uniquely designed monsters that consistently surprise and challenge the players throughout the game. The building is thoughtfully structured with intricate corridors and individual rooms; some rooms strategically house monsters while others are left empty, creating a suspenseful and eerie atmosphere as players navigate through. The primary objective for the players is to skillfully evade these monsters and escape from the building, adding a thrilling and engaging escape element to the gameplay. Some monsters roam the corridors while others ingeniously hide beneath or above to jump out and startle the players unexpectedly, enhancing the game's unpredictability and excitement.

This project marked my initial foray into creating an XR game entirely on my own. I was particularly intrigued by how to construct an endless space and control it through a controller. Initially, I was enlightened about the existence of specific operational nodes for XR devices, which was a fascinating discovery. Moreover, observing the distinct differences between XR controller nodes and regular game controller nodes was quite enlightening. Actively experiencing the space and navigating it within my own XR game was exceptionally intriguing. Engaging with coding for the first time in this course, I found it immensely interesting to strategically insert the appropriate code while visually playing the game, which has significantly fueled my desire to develop more sophisticated games. The practical experience of creatively building the game and realizing how developers craft these intricate experiences has profoundly deepened my respect for game creators. Although the game is relatively simple, I would feel incredibly proud and fulfilled if users found enjoyment and satisfaction in playing the game I meticulously developed.
The immersive nature of the game is further enhanced by the addition of a glitch-like texture to the walls using sophisticated computer techniques, creating an atmosphere that simulates the eerie sensation of navigating through a haunted digital world. The World Environment node is strategically implemented to effectively illuminate the vast interior of the game setting, significantly enhancing the visual experience and drawing players deeper into the game world. Additionally, the inclusion of a Static Body node in the building's structure rigorously prevents players from passing through walls, meticulously maintaining both immersion and realism in the virtual space. The XR Origin 3D node is a crucial and innovative feature that allows players to navigate the building using controllers, providing a comprehensive, interactive, and deeply exploratory gaming experience.

The auditory aspect of the game also plays a critical role in enhancing the overall gaming experience. The project includes a meticulously crafted low-tone, ominous background music that significantly intensifies the game's atmosphere, making the entire experience more immersive and subtly creepy. This carefully selected soundtrack complements the visual elements perfectly, creating a cohesive and enveloping environment that captivates the players' senses.
All these elements combine to instill a profound and deep sense of pride in your XR game creation. Despite challenges such as adding color to the monsters' OBJ files, this project has provided an invaluable opportunity to gain extensive hands-on experience with XR structure and manipulation techniques. This experience has not only enhanced my skills and understanding in game development but has also empowered me to create a more engaging, immersive, and technically sophisticated gaming experience. The journey of learning and implementing new technologies, understanding user interaction within a virtual environment, and crafting a narrative that keeps players engaged from start to finish has been an immensely rewarding aspect of this project.

In conclusion, the development of this XR game has not only been a technical achievement but also a personal journey of growth and discovery. The process of transforming initial concepts into a fully functional game that can potentially bring joy and excitement to players around the world is a testament to the power of creativity and technology combined. This project has ignited a passion for further exploration and innovation in the field of game development, setting the stage for future projects that will continue to challenge, entertain, and inspire.
