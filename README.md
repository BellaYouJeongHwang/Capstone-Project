This is Capstone Project Assignment

Description
My Backroom Capstone Project starts with 3D character designs that are simple yet engaging with a spooky aesthetic. This game features a bright, colorful yet eerie environment where players can freely explore through a control system that includes inputs for actions like walking and turning. Characters perform simple but repetitive actions such as walking and waving hands, with these actions looping through Godot's animation cycles.
The game's monsters consist of spiders, beasts, and killers, each repeating specific behaviors achieved through animation effects. The use of the World Environment node ensures light illuminates the entire building, and adding a Static Body node to the building prevents players from passing through it. The XR Origin 3D node allows players to walk inside the building using controllers, offering a truly explorative experience.
This project incorporates low tone but ominous background music, contributing to the overall atmosphere of the game and creating a subtle, creepy vibe. All these elements combine to give me a sense of pride in your own XR game creation. Although I faced difficulties adding color to the monster's OBJ files, this project provided valuable learning experiences in XR structure and manipulation techniques.
